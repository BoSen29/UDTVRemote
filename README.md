# UDTVRemote

So, i lost my TV remote, and had an old Galaxy S4 laying around with an IR Blaster and an IR Relay (after i managed to fry all my IR Diodes becasue 3.3V -ne 5V)

So, with the help of https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.remotefairy4 and Android Debug Bridge i put together this. 

Note: all the buttons are hardcoded with the x and y cords to simulate a touch tap. 

Might update this to utilize IR Diodes whenever i get around to order new ones.
